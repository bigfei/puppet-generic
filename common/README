This puppet module contains several default defines and classes that are useful
for the other modules used by Kumina bv. It's layout is derived from David
Schmitt's common module, as published by himself at [0]. Most of the defines and
other aspects of this class are taken from older modules developed by and for
Kumina bv or documentation at one time published by the puppet community.
